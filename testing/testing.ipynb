    "# Testing and Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is an important part of the software development process.\n",
    "It's usually not very fun, so it often goes overlooked and neglected.\n",
    "But it is critical and can also server as a vital part of debugging.\n",
    "Note that debugging (finding the cause of software issues) is not the same as testing (creating infrastructure to help discover and prevent software issues),\n",
    "but they have a lot of overlap.\n",
    "So you can also think of testing as investing in infrastructure to help future debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar vein of testing code, we also have grading code.\n",
    "They are pretty similar, but grading is usually a bit harder because you have to assign partial credit\n",
    "and give feedback that is specific enough to be helpful but not too specific as to give away the answer.\n",
    "Grading is not within the scope of this course, but understanding the basics of grading (and how they are similar to testing)\n",
    "can help you better understand how your own assignments are graded and hopefully help you get better scores."

    "## Testing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to test code, and many different types of tests (unit, integration, behavior, etc).\n",
    "In this exercise (and course) we are going to focus on [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing),\n",
    "which is writing tests for individual code units.\n",
    "A \"unit\" can be many different things (function, class, module, etc), but in our case it will usually be a single function.\n",
    "So we will want to make test functions that test functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using print statements generally falls under debugging rather than testing\n",
    "(but is very much encouraged for debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few popular testing frameworks in Python, note that this list is far from exhaustive:\n",
    " - [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) (Python standard library)\n",
    " - [pytest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)\n",
    " - [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)\n",
    " - [nose2](https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/)\n",
    " - [Testify](https://github.com/Yelp/Testify)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each framework has its own style, usage, and specific vocabulary, but it all comes down to the same thing:\n",
    "running code with known inputs and making sure the output matches.\n",
    "In this course, we are generally not going to make you write unit tests (we would if we had the time/units),\n",
    "but you will probably find yourself in situations where writing a test is the best way to fix/finish your code.\n",
    "So we encourage you to find a framework that you like and get familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class uses an autograding framework that is used to write your local tests (that you can run) and hidden tests (that are used to give you a score).\n",
    "Below, we will go through an example using the course's grading framework."
