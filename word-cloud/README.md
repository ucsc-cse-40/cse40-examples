# Word Cloud

This example uses the responses from a student survey (housed in `responses.txt`).
The specific question that these responses are from was:
```
What classes are you taking?
```

The `word-cloud.ipynb` notebook walks through creating a word cloud from the responses and various data cleaning steps that are done to improve the quality of the word cloud.
